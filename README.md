grape-versioned-boilerplate
===========================

Primitive boilerplate for a versioned Grape API, documented with Swagger.

Created as an aggregate of way too many hours of experimentation, trying to get
a versioned API that would document properly with Swagger, as header-based
versioning does not work with grape-swagger (as far as I could tell).

Usage
-----

- `git clone https://github.com/iv597/grape-versioned-boilerplate.git`
